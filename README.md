📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes social media post performance to identify patterns in engagement across platforms, content types, cities, and posting dates.

The goal is to transform raw engagement data into actionable business insights that help optimize content strategy and platform investment.

🎯 Business Objective

Measure and analyze Engagement Rate
