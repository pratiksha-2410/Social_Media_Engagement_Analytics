**Python | NumPy | SQL | Data Visualization**

## Project Overview

**This project analyzes social media post performance to identify patterns in engagement across platforms, content types, cities, and posting dates.**

**The goal is to transform raw engagement data into actionable business insights that help optimize content strategy and platform investment.**

## Business Objective

Measure and analyze Engagement Rate
